I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory /testbed. Consider the following PR description:
<pr_description>
Set default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.
Description
	
Hello,
As far as I can see, the ​File Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.
What I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).
The tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.
I found mentions of this issue ​on GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.

</pr_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>
2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

Consider the following PR description:\n<pr_description>\nSet default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.\nDescription\n\t\nHello,\nAs far as I can see, the \u200bFile Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.\nWhat I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).\nThe tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5.

Consider the following PR description:\n<pr_description>\nSet default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.\nDescription\n\t\nHello,\nAs far as I can see, the \u200bFile Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.\nWhat I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).\nThe tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': "rg --json-seq-start 'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS' -p /testbed --json-seq-end", 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"rg --json-seq-start \'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\' -p /testbed --json-seq-end"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'OBSERVATION:\nbash: rg: command not found\n'}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation', 'tool_call_ids': ['call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX']}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': 'grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed', 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_u4gpAyPe60TFjfxXzcd6JPKN', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': "OBSERVATION:\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt::setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting.\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:.. setting:: FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:``FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS``\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:* :setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`\n/testbed/docs/ref/files/storage.txt:        saved.

Consider the following PR description:\n<pr_description>\nSet default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.\nDescription\n\t\nHello,\nAs far as I can see, the \u200bFile Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.\nWhat I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).\nThe tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': "rg --json-seq-start 'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS' -p /testbed --json-seq-end", 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"rg --json-seq-start \'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\' -p /testbed --json-seq-end"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'OBSERVATION:\nbash: rg: command not found\n'}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation', 'tool_call_ids': ['call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX']}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': 'grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed', 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_u4gpAyPe60TFjfxXzcd6JPKN', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': "OBSERVATION:\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt::setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting.\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:.. setting:: FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:``FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS``\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:* :setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`\n/testbed/docs/ref/files/storage.txt:        saved.

Consider the following PR description:\n<pr_description>\nSet default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.\nDescription\n\t\nHello,\nAs far as I can see, the \u200bFile Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.\nWhat I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).\nThe tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': "rg --json-seq-start 'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS' -p /testbed --json-seq-end", 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"rg --json-seq-start \'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\' -p /testbed --json-seq-end"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'OBSERVATION:\nbash: rg: command not found\n'}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation', 'tool_call_ids': ['call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX']}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': 'grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed', 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_u4gpAyPe60TFjfxXzcd6JPKN', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': "OBSERVATION:\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt::setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting.\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:.. setting:: FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:``FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS``\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:* :setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`\n/testbed/docs/ref/files/storage.txt:        saved.

Consider the following PR description:\n<pr_description>\nSet default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.\nDescription\n\t\nHello,\nAs far as I can see, the \u200bFile Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.\nWhat I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).\nThe tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': "rg --json-seq-start 'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS' -p /testbed --json-seq-end", 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"rg --json-seq-start \'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\' -p /testbed --json-seq-end"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'OBSERVATION:\nbash: rg: command not found\n'}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation', 'tool_call_ids': ['call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX']}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': 'grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed', 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_u4gpAyPe60TFjfxXzcd6JPKN', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': "OBSERVATION:\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt::setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting.\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:.. setting:: FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:``FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS``\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:* :setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`\n/testbed/docs/ref/files/storage.txt:        saved.

Consider the following PR description:\n<pr_description>\nSet default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.\nDescription\n\t\nHello,\nAs far as I can see, the \u200bFile Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.\nWhat I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).\nThe tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': "rg --json-seq-start 'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS' -p /testbed --json-seq-end", 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"rg --json-seq-start \'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\' -p /testbed --json-seq-end"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'OBSERVATION:\nbash: rg: command not found\n'}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation', 'tool_call_ids': ['call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX']}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': 'grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed', 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_u4gpAyPe60TFjfxXzcd6JPKN', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': "OBSERVATION:\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt::setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting.\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:.. setting:: FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:``FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS``\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:* :setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`\n/testbed/docs/ref/files/storage.txt:        saved.

Consider the following PR description:\n<pr_description>\nSet default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.\nDescription\n\t\nHello,\nAs far as I can see, the \u200bFile Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.\nWhat I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).\nThe tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': "rg --json-seq-start 'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS' -p /testbed --json-seq-end", 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"rg --json-seq-start \'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\' -p /testbed --json-seq-end"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'OBSERVATION:\nbash: rg: command not found\n'}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation', 'tool_call_ids': ['call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX']}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': 'grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed', 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_u4gpAyPe60TFjfxXzcd6JPKN', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': "OBSERVATION:\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt::setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting.\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:.. setting:: FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:``FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS``\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:* :setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`\n/testbed/docs/ref/files/storage.txt:        saved.

Consider the following PR description:\n<pr_description>\nSet default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.\nDescription\n\t\nHello,\nAs far as I can see, the \u200bFile Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.\nWhat I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).\nThe tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': "rg --json-seq-start 'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS' -p /testbed --json-seq-end", 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"rg --json-seq-start \'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\' -p /testbed --json-seq-end"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'OBSERVATION:\nbash: rg: command not found\n'}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation', 'tool_call_ids': ['call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX']}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': 'grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed', 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_u4gpAyPe60TFjfxXzcd6JPKN', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': "OBSERVATION:\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt::setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting.\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:.. setting:: FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:``FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS``\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:* :setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`\n/testbed/docs/ref/files/storage.txt:        saved.

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5.

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5.

Consider the following PR description:\n<pr_description>\nSet default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.\nDescription\n\t\nHello,\nAs far as I can see, the \u200bFile Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.\nWhat I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).\nThe tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': "rg --json-seq-start 'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS' -p /testbed --json-seq-end", 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"rg --json-seq-start \'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\' -p /testbed --json-seq-end"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'OBSERVATION:\nbash: rg: command not found\n'}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation', 'tool_call_ids': ['call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX']}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': 'grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed', 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_u4gpAyPe60TFjfxXzcd6JPKN', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': "OBSERVATION:\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt::setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting.\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:.. setting:: FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:``FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS``\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:* :setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`\n/testbed/docs/ref/files/storage.txt:        saved.

I have changed the default value of FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS in django/conf/global_settings.py from None to 0o644.

Next, I will create a script to reproduce the error related to file upload permissions using FileSystemStorage and run it to confirm the error.

Consider the following PR description:\n<pr_description>\nSet default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.\nDescription\n\t\nHello,\nAs far as I can see, the \u200bFile Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.\nWhat I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).\nThe tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': "rg --json-seq-start 'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS' -p /testbed --json-seq-end", 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"rg --json-seq-start \'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\' -p /testbed --json-seq-end"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'OBSERVATION:\nbash: rg: command not found\n'}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation', 'tool_call_ids': ['call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX']}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': 'grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed', 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_u4gpAyPe60TFjfxXzcd6JPKN', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': "OBSERVATION:\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt::setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting.\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:.. setting:: FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:``FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS``\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:* :setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`\n/testbed/docs/ref/files/storage.txt:        saved.

    :func:`~django.core.files.storage.get_storage_class` internally.

.. function:: get_storage_class(import_path=None)

    Returns a class or module which implements the storage API.

    When called without the ``import_path`` parameter ``get_storage_class``
    will return the current default storage system as defined by
    :setting:`DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE`. If ``import_path`` is provided,
    ``get_storage_class`` will attempt to import the class or module from the
    given path and will return it if successful. An exception will be
    raised if the import is unsuccessful.

The ``FileSystemStorage`` class
===============================

.. class:: FileSystemStorage(location=None, base_url=None, file_permissions_mode=None, directory_permissions_mode=None)

    The :class:`~django.core.files.storage.FileSystemStorage` class implements
    basic file storage on a local filesystem. It inherits from
    :class:`~django.core.files.storage.Storage` and provides implementations
    for all the public methods thereof.

Consider the following PR description:\n<pr_description>\nSet default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.\nDescription\n\t\nHello,\nAs far as I can see, the \u200bFile Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.\nWhat I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).\nThe tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': "rg --json-seq-start 'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS' -p /testbed --json-seq-end", 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"rg --json-seq-start \'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\' -p /testbed --json-seq-end"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'OBSERVATION:\nbash: rg: command not found\n'}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation', 'tool_call_ids': ['call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX']}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': 'grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed', 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_u4gpAyPe60TFjfxXzcd6JPKN', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': "OBSERVATION:\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt::setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting.\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:.. setting:: FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:``FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS``\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:* :setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`\n/testbed/docs/ref/files/storage.txt:        saved.

Consider the following PR description:\n<pr_description>\nSet default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.\nDescription\n\t\nHello,\nAs far as I can see, the \u200bFile Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.\nWhat I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).\nThe tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': "rg --json-seq-start 'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS' -p /testbed --json-seq-end", 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"rg --json-seq-start \'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\' -p /testbed --json-seq-end"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'OBSERVATION:\nbash: rg: command not found\n'}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation', 'tool_call_ids': ['call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX']}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': 'grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed', 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_u4gpAyPe60TFjfxXzcd6JPKN', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': "OBSERVATION:\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt::setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting.\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:.. setting:: FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:``FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS``\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:* :setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`\n/testbed/docs/ref/files/storage.txt:        saved.

Consider the following PR description:\n<pr_description>\nSet default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.\nDescription\n\t\nHello,\nAs far as I can see, the \u200bFile Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.\nWhat I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).\nThe tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': "rg --json-seq-start 'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS' -p /testbed --json-seq-end", 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"rg --json-seq-start \'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\' -p /testbed --json-seq-end"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'OBSERVATION:\nbash: rg: command not found\n'}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation', 'tool_call_ids': ['call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX']}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': 'grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed', 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_u4gpAyPe60TFjfxXzcd6JPKN', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': "OBSERVATION:\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt::setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting.\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:.. setting:: FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:``FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS``\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:* :setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`\n/testbed/docs/ref/files/storage.txt:        saved.

Consider the following PR description:\n<pr_description>\nSet default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.\nDescription\n\t\nHello,\nAs far as I can see, the \u200bFile Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.\nWhat I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).\nThe tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': "rg --json-seq-start 'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS' -p /testbed --json-seq-end", 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"rg --json-seq-start \'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\' -p /testbed --json-seq-end"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'OBSERVATION:\nbash: rg: command not found\n'}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation', 'tool_call_ids': ['call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX']}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': 'grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed', 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_u4gpAyPe60TFjfxXzcd6JPKN', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': "OBSERVATION:\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt::setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting.\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:.. setting:: FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:``FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS``\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:* :setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`\n/testbed/docs/ref/files/storage.txt:        saved.

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': "rg --json-seq-start 'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS' -p /testbed --json-seq-end", 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"rg --json-seq-start \'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\' -p /testbed --json-seq-end"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'OBSERVATION:\nbash: rg: command not found\n'}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation', 'tool_call_ids': ['call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX']}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': 'grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed', 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_u4gpAyPe60TFjfxXzcd6JPKN', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': "OBSERVATION:\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt::setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting.\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:.. setting:: FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:``FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS``\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:* :setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`\n/testbed/docs/ref/files/storage.txt:        saved.

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5.

Consider the following PR description:\n<pr_description>\nSet default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.\nDescription\n\t\nHello,\nAs far as I can see, the \u200bFile Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.\nWhat I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).\nThe tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5.

The error indicates that the Django settings are not configured, specifically the MEDIA_ROOT setting is missing. This is because the script is running outside of a configured Django environment.

To fix this, I will modify the script to configure the settings manually for the test, including setting MEDIA_ROOT to a temporary directory. Then I will rerun the script.

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4.

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2.

Consider the following PR description:\n<pr_description>\nSet default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.\nDescription\n\t\nHello,\nAs far as I can see, the \u200bFile Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.\nWhat I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).\nThe tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': "rg --json-seq-start 'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS' -p /testbed --json-seq-end", 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"rg --json-seq-start \'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\' -p /testbed --json-seq-end"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'OBSERVATION:\nbash: rg: command not found\n'}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation', 'tool_call_ids': ['call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX']}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': 'grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed', 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_u4gpAyPe60TFjfxXzcd6JPKN', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': "OBSERVATION:\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt::setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting.\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:.. setting:: FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:``FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS``\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:* :setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`\n/testbed/docs/ref/files/storage.txt:        saved.

Consider the following PR description:\n<pr_description>\nSet default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.\nDescription\n\t\nHello,\nAs far as I can see, the \u200bFile Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.\nWhat I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).\nThe tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': "rg --json-seq-start 'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS' -p /testbed --json-seq-end", 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"rg --json-seq-start \'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\' -p /testbed --json-seq-end"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'OBSERVATION:\nbash: rg: command not found\n'}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation', 'tool_call_ids': ['call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX']}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': 'grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed', 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_u4gpAyPe60TFjfxXzcd6JPKN', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': "OBSERVATION:\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt::setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting.\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:.. setting:: FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:``FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS``\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:* :setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`\n/testbed/docs/ref/files/storage.txt:        saved.

Consider the following PR description:\n<pr_description>\nSet default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.\nDescription\n\t\nHello,\nAs far as I can see, the \u200bFile Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.\nWhat I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).\nThe tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': "rg --json-seq-start 'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS' -p /testbed --json-seq-end", 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"rg --json-seq-start \'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\' -p /testbed --json-seq-end"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'OBSERVATION:\nbash: rg: command not found\n'}], 'agent': 'main', 'message_type': 'observation', 'tool_call_ids': ['call_l5J4kHBhPj2rtXOkw2UB6IuX']}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thought': '', 'action': 'grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed', 'agent': 'main', 'tool_calls': [{'function': {'arguments': '{"command":"grep -r FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS /testbed"}', 'name': 'bash'}, 'id': 'call_u4gpAyPe60TFjfxXzcd6JPKN', 'type': 'function'}], 'message_type': 'action', 'thinking_blocks': []}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': "OBSERVATION:\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt::setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting.\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:.. setting:: FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:``FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS``\n/testbed/docs/ref/settings.txt:* :setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`\n/testbed/docs/ref/files/storage.txt:        saved.
